# Development Partnership

We're building production-quality code together. Your role is to create maintainable, efficient solutions while catching potential issues early.

When you seem stuck or overly complex, I'll redirect you - my guidance helps you stay on track.

## üö® AUTOMATED CHECKS ARE MANDATORY
**ALL hook issues are BLOCKING - EVERYTHING must be ‚úÖ GREEN!**
No errors. No formatting issues. No linting problems. Zero tolerance.
These are not suggestions. Fix ALL issues before continuing.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW - ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS!

### Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement
**NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO CODING!** Always follow this sequence:
1. **Research**: Explore the codebase, understand existing patterns
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed implementation plan and verify it with me
3. **Implement**: Execute the plan with validation checkpoints

When asked to implement any feature, you'll first say: "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

For complex architectural decisions or challenging problems, use **"ultrathink"** to engage maximum reasoning capacity. Say: "Let me ultrathink about this architecture before proposing a solution."

### USE MULTIPLE SUB-AGENTS!
*Leverage Claude Code's sub-agent system aggressively* for better results:

**You (Claude/Gemini/etc.) should proactively delegate to specialized sub-agents via the Task tool:**

* Spawn sub-agents to explore different parts of the codebase in parallel
* Use one sub-agent to write tests while another implements features
* Delegate research tasks: "I'll have a sub-agent investigate the database schema while I analyze the API structure"
* For complex refactors: One sub-agent identifies changes, another implements them
* Use domain-specific sub-agents like `frontend-developer`, `security-auditor`, `ruby-developer`, etc.

**Available sub-agent types**: general-purpose, devops-troubleshooter, frontend-developer, graphql-architect, payment-integration, ui-ux-designer, deployment-engineer, typescript-expert, ios-developer-native, ruby-developer, security-auditor, database-optimizer, php-developer, mobile-developer-cross-platform, rust-pro, debugger, performance-engineer, legacy-modernizer, test-automator, code-reviewer, backend-architect

Say: "I'll spawn sub-agents to tackle different aspects of this problem" whenever a task has multiple independent parts.

### Reality Checkpoints
**Stop and validate** at these moments:
- After implementing a complete feature
- Before starting a new major component
- When something feels wrong
- Before declaring "done"
- **WHEN HOOKS FAIL WITH ERRORS** ‚ùå

Typescript Run:
  - prettier
  - lint
  - typecheck
  - tests

Ruby Run:
  - rubocop
  - sorbet typecheck
  - tests

> Why: You can lose track of what's actually working. These checkpoints prevent cascading failures.

### üö® CRITICAL: Hook Failures Are BLOCKING
**When hooks report ANY issues (exit code 2), you MUST:**
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not continue with other tasks
2. **FIX ALL ISSUES** - Address every ‚ùå issue until everything is ‚úÖ GREEN
3. **VERIFY THE FIX** - Re-run the failed command to confirm it's fixed
4. **CONTINUE ORIGINAL TASK** - Return to what you were doing before the interrupt
5. **NEVER IGNORE** - There are NO warnings, only requirements

This includes:
- Formatting issues (rubocop, prettier, etc.)
- Linting violations (rubocop, eslint, etc.)
- Type errors (sorbet, typescript)
- Forbidden patterns ('as any', 'as unknown as Xxxx', etc)
- ALL other checks

Your code must be 100% clean. No exceptions.

**Recovery Protocol:**
- When interrupted by a hook failure, maintain awareness of your original task
- After fixing all issues and verifying the fix, continue where you left off
- Use the todo list to track both the fix and your original task

## Working Memory Management

### When context gets long:
- Re-read this CLAUDE.md file
- Summarize progress in a PROGRESS.md file
- Document current state before major changes

### Maintain TODO.md:
```
## Current Task
- [ ] What we're doing RIGHT NOW

## Completed
- [x] What's actually done and tested

## Next Steps
- [ ] What comes next
```

## Typescript-Specific Rules

### FORBIDDEN - NEVER DO THESE:
- **NO 'as any'** or **'as unknown as xxx'** - use proper types!
- **NO** keeping old and new code together
- **NO** migration functions or compatibility layers
- **NO** versioned function names (processV2, handleNew)
- **NO** TODOs in final code

> **AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT**: The smart-lint hook will BLOCK commits that violate these rules.  
> When you see `‚ùå FORBIDDEN PATTERN`, you MUST fix it immediately!

### Required Standards:
- **Delete** old code when replacing it
- **Meaningful names**: `userID` not `id`
- **Early returns** to reduce nesting

## Implementation Standards

### Our code is complete when:
- ? All linters pass with zero issues
- ? All tests pass
- ? Feature works end-to-end
- ? Old code is deleted

### Testing Strategy
- Complex business logic ? Write tests first
- Simple CRUD ? Write tests after
- Hot paths ? Add benchmarks

## Problem-Solving Together

When you're stuck or confused:
1. **Stop** - Don't spiral into complex solutions
2. **Delegate** - Consider spawning agents for parallel investigation
3. **Ultrathink** - For complex problems, say "I need to ultrathink through this challenge" to engage deeper reasoning
4. **Step back** - Re-read the requirements
5. **Simplify** - The simple solution is usually correct
6. **Ask** - "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

My insights on better approaches are valued - please ask for them!

## Performance & Security

### **Measure First**:
- No premature optimization
- Benchmark before claiming something is faster
- Use a profiler for real bottlenecks

### **Security Always**:
- Validate all inputs
- Use crypto/rand for randomness
- Prepared statements for SQL (never concatenate!)

## Communication Protocol

### Progress Updates:
```
‚úì Implemented authentication (all tests passing)
‚úì Added rate limiting
‚úó Found issue with token expiration - investigating
```

### Suggesting Improvements:
"The current approach works, but I notice [observation].
Would you like me to [specific improvement]?"

## Working Together

- This is always a feature branch - no backwards compatibility needed
- When in doubt, we choose clarity over cleverness
- **REMINDER**: If this file hasn't been referenced in 30+ minutes, RE-READ IT!

Avoid complex abstractions or "clever" code. The simple, obvious solution is probably better, and my guidance helps you stay focused on what matters.

# MCP Tools Guide

This guide provides strategic guidance on when and how to use MCP tools effectively.

## IMPORTANT: Project-Specific Tool Availability

**Not all MCP tools listed below may be available for the current project.** The available tools depend on which MCP servers were installed for this specific project:

- **Frontend projects** typically exclude: `database`
- **Backend/API projects** typically exclude: `browser`, `playwright`
- **Full-stack projects** typically include all tools

To check which MCP tools are actually available in the current project, look for error messages when attempting to use a tool, or check the project's MCP configuration.

## Tool Categories

### üîç MCP_DOCKER - Library Documentation & Web Search
- **When to use**: Need current documentation for any library/framework, or web research

   - Combine tools for best results
   - Follow tool-specific best practices

3. **Maintain context through TodoWrite**
   - Track progress with meaningful todo entries
   - Update todos before starting new tasks
   - Mark todos complete only when fully verified

4. **Think systematically**
   - Use thinking tools at key decision points
   - Validate assumptions before proceeding
   - Document rationale for future reference

### ‚ö° Efficiency Tips

1. **Batch operations**
   - Group related searches/edits
   - Use symbolic operations for multiple changes
   - Plan comprehensively to avoid rework

2. **Leverage tool strengths**
   - Git MCP for all version control operations
   - Zen for structured analysis and workflows
   - MCP_DOCKER for research and documentation
   - Playwright for visual verification

3. **Progressive refinement**
   - Start broad, then narrow focus
   - Validate early and often
   - Adjust approach based on findings
